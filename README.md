# Pomos
**Pomos** is a customizable pomodoro timer web app (with stats, if you desire!). It was built wiith React and Sass on the frontend, and Supabase on the backend.
I'm currently working on quality of life improvements and small fixes.

## How it works!
On the surface, it's a simple timer that alternates between a focus timer, and a short break, with an optional longer break at the end.

Click the settings icon to reveal a little menu-- this is where you can edit the lengths of your work and break sessions, and the amount of repeats for this cycle.
Plus, extras like a dark mode toggle and sound effect on timer completion.

There's also a stat tracking feature, for anybody interested. It requires you to sign up with an email address to access it.
Here's how mine looks, time of writing!
